# The Flask Mega Tutorial
There is this great tutorial online that was graciously posted by Miguel Grinberg.  You can find the whole tutorial at his blog site. [miguelgrinberg.com](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world)

As I am working through this tutorial I decided to pull the code together in this repo and provide some updates/tweaks as this came out in 2017.  Where I differ from Miguels code I will make sure to point it out.  I am a full stack developer and I like the MEAN stack.  Lately, however, there has been a lot of work in the Python space so I wanted to up my skills in this area.

This tutorial focuses on Python Flask Web Development.  My intent is to expand it a bit and also add in API development and consumption.
